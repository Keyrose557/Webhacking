- [ ] Steps to recreate:
<br /> - Try common usernames in the TARGET's login page, guess common passwords. Maybe we'll get some helpful info. Lets PLAN our attack.
<br /> - Kali is a great toolbox. Lets use our handy dandy tool wpSCAN to gather information on a TARGET. Perfome RECONNAISSANCE.
<br /> - After some poking and proding with WPSCAN lets use our collected INTEL to test our might. Commense Brute Force Attack!!! 
<br /> - Have I been pwned? Lets use the compromised credentials. GAIN ACCESS!!!
<br /> - Lets cause some damage...hmmm how about we just add a way to get back in. Add our own administrator ;). MAINTAIN ACCESS
<br /> - Considerations: COVER YOUR TRACKS!!!

- [ ] Steps to recreate: 
- Scan the Target for a weakness.
- Bring out the right tool for the job. Use Metasploit Framework (msf) to attempt an exploit.  
- Take aim and shoot. Are we in? Cool, leave a way to Maintain Access. Inject a reverse shell so our target does all the work.
- Now, we wait and listen. 
- You are now an agent of chaos

## Notes

Setting up the pen testing environment was really challenging. I had a tough time getting windows 10 to play nice with vagrant and virtual box. I persevered, through trial and error. My saving grace was utilizing the snapshot feature when things went wrong. This was key in troubleshooting and documenting solutions along the way. My advice for my fellow colleagues and academics, donâ€™t get discouraged, our failures are our greatest teachers.

Solutions for Common Isssues:

- https://gitforwindows.org/ (required for windows, install it)
- https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ (use to edit config.yml & hosts file as administrator)
- Create a restore point in Virtual Box once wpdistillery is up and running to revert ( Windows Powershell Failure to reboot vm issue, exploits not functioning issue)
- https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_6_1 (for MacOS network adapter issues and KERNAL driver not installed)
- For MacOS check Security & Privacy: Allow apps downloaded from: SELECT app store and identified developers (make sure virtual box isnt being blocked)
- For MacOS in VirtualBoX settings disable Audio (virtual machine aborts issue)
