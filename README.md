## Pen Testing Report

### 1. User Enumeration (CVE-2020-7918)

  - Vulnerability types: Insecure direct object reference
  - Tested version: 4.2
  - Fixed version: NOT FIXED
  - Affected source code: (http://wpdistillery.vm/wp-login.php)
  - Tools/Resources Used:
 <br /> https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines
 <br /> https://www.kali.org/tools/wpscan
 <br /> https://wpscan.com/
 <br /> https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7918
 <br /> password list: rockyou.txt
  - Techniques: BruteForce, Dictionary Attack, Credential Stuffing
  - Preventative Action: Password Complexity, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), Password Manager, Account Lockout Policy
  - Commands used:
  <br /> sudo gunzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz (extract and move for ease of use)
  <br /> wpscan -h (Display the Help)
  <br /> wpscan --url http://wpdistillery.vm (Reconnasissance)
  <br /> wpscan --url http://wpdistillery.vm --enumerate u (Finding Usernames)
  <br /> wpscan --url http://wpdistillery.vm -U ~/Desktop/wpusers.txt -P ~/Desktop/rockyou.txt (BruteForce Attack)
  


- [ ] Walkthrough:
<br /> Where's the Beef ?!?
<img src="user_enum1.gif">
<br /> A Successful Attack against all 5 User Accounts took 2min and 11 seconds !?!
<img src="BruteForce.gif">
<br /> The Damage... We got User credentials, PII, and our very own Administrative Account !?!

- [ ] Steps to recreate:
<br /> - Try common usernames in the TARGET's login page, guess common passwords. Maybe we'll get some helpful info. Lets PLAN our attack.
<br /> - Kali is a great toolbox. Lets use our handy dandy tool wpSCAN to gather information on a TARGET. Perfome RECONNAISSANCE.
<br /> - After some poking and proding with WPSCAN lets use our collected INTEL to test our might. Commense Brute Force Attack!!! 
<br /> - Have I been pwned? Lets use the compromised credentials. GAIN ACCESS!!!
<br /> - Lets cause some damage...hmmm how about we just add a way to get back in. Add our own administrator ;). MAINTAIN ACCESS
<br /> - Considerations: COVER YOUR TRACKS!!!

- [ ] Steps to recreate:
<br /> - Scan the Target for a weakness.
<br /> - Bring out the right tool for the job. Use Metasploit Framework to attempt an exploit.  
<br /> - Take aim and shoot. Are we in? Cool, leave a way to Maintain Access.Inject a reverse shell.
<br /> - Now, we wait and listen. 
<br /> - Knock Knock...You are now an agent of chaos.
<br />  Considerations: Privilege Escalation should be attempted

## Notes

Setting up the pen testing environment was really challenging. I had a tough time getting windows 10 to play nice with vagrant and virtual box. I persevered, through trial and error. My saving grace was utilizing the snapshot feature when things went wrong. This was key in troubleshooting and documenting solutions along the way. My advice for my fellow colleagues and academics, donâ€™t get discouraged, our failures are our greatest teachers.

Solutions for Common Isssues:

- https://gitforwindows.org/ (required for windows, install it)
- https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ (use to edit config.yml & hosts file as administrator)
- Create a restore point in Virtual Box once wpdistillery is up and running to revert ( Windows Powershell Failure to reboot vm issue, exploits not functioning issue)
- https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_6_1 (for MacOS network adapter issues and KERNAL driver not installed)
- For MacOS check Security & Privacy: Allow apps downloaded from: SELECT app store and identified developers (make sure virtual box isnt being blocked)
- For MacOS in VirtualBoX settings disable Audio (virtual machine aborts issue)
